# Stuck in the middle with you

Well, I don't know why I came here tonight
D
I got the feeling that something ain't right
       G
I'm so scared in case I fall off my chair,
        D
And I'm wondering how I'll get down those stairs

A                         C             G  
Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right,
       D
Here I am, stuck in the middle with you

Yes, I'm stuck in the middle with you,
And I'm wondering what it is I should do
It's so hard to keep this smile from my face,
Losing control, and I'm all over the place

Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right,
Here I am, stuck in the middle with you

          G
Well, you started off with nothing,
                                              D
And you're proud that you're a self-made man
         G
And your friends they all come crawling,
Slap you on the back and say,
D       A
Please, please

Trying to make some sense of it all,
But I can see it makes no sense at all
Is it cool to go to sleep on the floor?
'Cause I don't think that I can take anymore

Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right,
Here I am, stuck in the middle with you

And you started off with nothing,
And you're proud that you're a self-made man
And your friends they all come crawling,
Slap you on the back and say,
Please, please.

Yeah, I don't know why I came here tonight
I got the feeling that something ain't right
I'm so scared in case I fall off my chair,
And I'm wondering how I'll get down those stairs

Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right,
Here I am, stuck in the middle with you
Yes, I'm stuck in the middle with you
Stuck in the middle with you
Here I am, stuck in the middle with you
